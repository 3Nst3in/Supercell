about the 90% of the aspects of the games. Info about:
- Players
- Teams 
- Tournaments / Events
- Cards

### Why Supercell ? ü§î

Supercell provides all the available info about the prementioned categories. Also it combines data analysis (and soon visualization) in order to provide to the user additional information.
